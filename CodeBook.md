# Code Book

Code book provides a summary of variables, data, and all the transformation works performed to clean up the original data.

## Variables

* `subject`: identifies the person who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from `1` to `30`. 
* `activity`: identifies the activities each person performed in the experiment. 6 possible values include `WALKING`, `WALKING _UPSTAIRS`, `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`, `SITTING`, `STANDING`, and `LAYING`. 

Following features are bounded within [-1, 1]

## Data

`Tidy.txt` flat file contains 180 records across aforementioned 81 variables. Each record represent the average measurement of the 79 features for specific subject performing specific activity. 

## Transformations

Original data were stored in two divided sets: `train` and `test`. Subject and activity information was also stored separately. 

The first step of the cleansing process is to identify relevant variables (features that involve mean or standard deviation measurements). Feature labels are processed to make sure they are clear and understandable. 

Then two sets are combined. Subject and activity columns are added, and descriptive variable names are assigned. 

The last step is to melt and cast to produce average measurements of each variables across subject and activity.
